# Noah's *old* Portfolio Site ✨

### It's old :) the new one is up on github.com/2of

## What's here and why is it structured like that? 🤔

This is my portfolio site... it's hosted on GitHub Pages...

We *could* query for project and writing information from elsewhere, but for now, it's easy enough to let React handle the asset load and bake it all into one. There aren't enough assets or text to really warrant complex setups just yet. 📦

In a lot of honesty, this site also serves as a 'playground' for myself. 

## Tech Stack 🔧

- Built with **React** 🖥️
- **React Router DOM** for routing
- A few quality-of-life libraries to get things going

## Mobile View 📱

The mobile view is designed to emulate the **TikTok-style** single-page scrolling, but it also supports **half scrolls** for a smoother experience. 🌀

## Current State ⚠️

There are still a bunch of padding issues, so it's a work in progress. 🚧

## /nonsense Route 🛠️

This route is packed with random test components, just for fun and experimentation. 🤪

## Also

The dark mode toggle graphic (with lights and moon 🌙 or sun ☀️ and clouds and silly animations) is over the top. Thank you.

Feel free to poke around!

## Code Structure 🧑‍💻

- The code is structured with **matching `.module.scss`** files (using SCSS for styling), all organized in the same directories.
- There’s also a **layout.js** file to handle the outlets — standard React SPA stuff.
