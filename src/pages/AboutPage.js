            <h3>IT Work Experience</h3>
            <p>In addition to my work in AI and machine learning, Iâ€™ve gained valuable experience working for a managed service provider, where I was responsible for supporting and maintaining a variety of IT services across multiple clients. My role involved working with Google Admin, Microsoft 365, Entra Tenant, Intune, and Windows Server. I became well-versed in managing user permissions, deploying devices, setting up networks, and securing cloud environments.</p>
            
            <p>My networking skills include configuring DNS, DHCP, VPNs, and managing firewalls. I have hands-on experience with both on-premise and cloud infrastructure, including cloud providers like AWS, GCP, and Azure. Additionally, I am familiar with security best practices, ensuring systems are properly configured, and complying with organizational policies.</p>
            
            <h3>Sales Experience</h3>
            <p>I also had a stint in sales, where I was responsible for understanding customer needs, negotiating contracts, and closing deals. This experience helped me develop strong communication skills, which I now use in collaborative work environments and when explaining complex technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders.</p>

            <h3>Projects</h3>
            <p>I'm continuously working on interesting projects. Here's a snapshot of a few:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Deep Learning GeoLocalization Model</strong>: Using pre-trained OCR, object detection, and scene analysis models to inform an attention-based model for geolocation prediction.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Responsive Portfolio Website</strong>: The very website you're browsing right now! Built with React, SCSS, and Node.js, it's designed to be responsive and robust across devices.
